# ReactJS calendar - test


## Introduction
This was an entry test for a job interview:

### HTML Calendar  

The task:

The program reads a date or uses the current date by default and renders a month as an 
output. The month should be in a calendar format:
-   First row is the name of the days (Mon, Tue, â€¦)
-   Weeks of the month should be in separate rows where the days listed as numbers
-   The current day should be marked in bold
-   The weekend should be marked in different color than the workdays
